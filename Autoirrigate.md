There are different ways to design an automatic irrigation system using a hydro sensor, a solenoid, and drip irrigation. One possible schematic is shown below, based on the project by The_TechnocratÂ². You can use an Arduino UNO to control the system, a soil moisture sensor to read the moisture content of the soil, a 16x2 LCD display to monitor the soil status and water supply, a water level switch to detect the water level in the tank, a speaker to alert you when the tank is low on water, a 5V relay to switch on and off the solenoid valve, and a water pump to deliver water to the drip emitters. You can also add a temperature sensor if you want to check the ambient temperature.
